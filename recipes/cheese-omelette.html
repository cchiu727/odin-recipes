    <h4>A delicious cheese omelette recipe from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/262696/cheese-omelette/">allrecipes</a>. This omelette cheese recipe is 1 serving, takes 5 minutes to prep, and 10 minutes to cook.</h4>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp milk, or as needed</li> 
        <li>desired amount of salt and ground white pepper</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded Emmentaler cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs in a bowl with a whisk. Add milk and season with salt and white pepper. Whisk for a few minutes until egg mixture is foamy; beating in air makes the omelette fluffy.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and twirl skillet so bottom is evenly covered with egg. Cook for 1 minute until egg starts to set. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the skillet so uncooked egg mixture can run towards the bottom of the skillet to set. Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip omelette and cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute. Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese in one line in the middle of the omelette and fold omelette in half. Cook for 20 seconds, then slide omelette onto plate.</li>
    </ol>
